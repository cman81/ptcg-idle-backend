Each pack contains 10 cards.
1 energy, 5 common, 3 uncommon, and 1 "rare"

that "rare" card can be even more rare:
holo rare = 1 / 4 packs
ultra rare = 1 / 8 packs
secret rare = 1 / 72 packs

a manual way to determine which rare card to pull:
roll a D4:
  1-3 = rare
  4 = roll a D2:
    1 = holo rare
    2 = roll a D9:
      1-8 = ultra rare
      9 = secret rare



How about the 3-card (dollar store) packs?
